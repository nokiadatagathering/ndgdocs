Search and Column Filtering
***************************

Search is both contextual and dynamic. This means that different search options are presented depending on whether you are in the :doc:`survey-list`, :doc:`user-admin` or :doc:`results`

   Searching for Surveys

The above image shows that surveys can be search for using ID, Name or Publisher. Selecting Survey Name from the drop down and 't' in the search box will filter all Survey Names with 't' as seen below

   Contextual Survey Search

The same principle applies when searching Results for Title, User, Date Sent or Location (lat/long)

   Search Results by Location

and when searching Users for Name, E-mail or Phone Number. The :doc:`survey-list`, :doc:`user-admin` or :doc:`results` columns can also be sorted and this is done by clicking to the side of the column to be filtered. A small black arrow will be displayed to indicate the direction of the sorting. In the image below we are sorting surveys by the number of Results
