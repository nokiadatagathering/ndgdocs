Search and Column Filtering
***************************

Search is both contextual and dynamic. This means that different search options are presented depending on whether you are in the :doc:`survey-list`, :doc:`user-admin` or :doc:`results`

and also when searching Users. The :doc:`survey-list`, :doc:`user-admin` or :doc:`results` columns can also be sorted and this is done by clicking to the side of the column to be filtered where a small black arrow is displayed
