Getting Started
**********************

To get started with Microsoft Data Gathering, you need to create an account on our Playground Server. To do this, go to `the server 
<https://nokiadatagathering.net>`_ and fill in the fields shown in the box. Select a username and password, and enter your first name, last name, email address, phone number and company/organization affiliation in the appropriate boxes. Then click the Create Account button. This will create a super admin account on the server which has permissions to add other admin users, field workers and operators. Normally organisations only need to register once to the playground server and then the super admin account be given to the person responsible for data gathering within the organisation

**In the context of NDG an admin role can add, delete and edit both users and surveys from the server. Operators can log into the server and manipulate surveys but they cannot change other users information. Field workers cannot log in to the server but can send and receive surveys and results from the field**
