Notifications
*************


Some actions have notifications which can be undone if selected in error by a user. For example take a look at the notification we see when trying to delete a survey (only unpublished surveys can be deleted)

   :alt: Survey Delete Notification

Such notifications are used throughout the application. Look at the notification when saving a survey for example

   :alt: Survey Save Notification
