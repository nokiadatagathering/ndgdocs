Nokia Data Gathering is a solution that helps organizations to *collect field data using mobile phones* instead of paper forms, PDAs or laptops. Since mobile phones can send data from many remote locations, collected data can be transmitted in near real-time for analysis. This makes collection of data much faster, more accurate and more cost effective to gather especially in remote locations when dealing with critical issues, such as public health, agricultural stock levels, emergency services and alike.
The solution consists of *two modules, server and mobile phone*, to enable smooth information transfer from the survey administrators to the field workforce and vice versa. The process includes the creation of questionnaires, their delivery to mobile phones and the subsequent integration and analysis of results. 
Mobile based data collection offers lots of benefits compared to traditional paper and pen based method as well as compared to data collection with help of a PC:  

- *Speed and efficiency*: ability to transmit and process time-critical data quickly. The more remote the location, the greater the improvement
- *Data accuracy*: removes the need for interpretation of hand-written data and potential mistyping of information when it is transferred from paper to legacy systems
- *Reduced operating costs*: reduces duplication of work (data entry) and removes unnecessary travel. Further the costs of delayed decisions can be considerable.
- *Reduced environmental impact*: minimizes the frequency and need for heavy load transportation and carrying papers in and out - especially at remote locations.
- *Usability*: mobile phones as data collection tools are light-weight small devices with long battery life. Furthermore many of them provide GPS in-build and easier to use than PCs while standing/on the move.

Compared to other mobile based data collection tools, Nokia Data Gathering offers high usability (easy to use Java and Windows phone based clients), complete end-to-end system (including mobile and server modules (with integrated survey editor) allowing organizations to host their own server and have security in the knowledge that the data collected by them will remain in-house) and ability to graph and map the results.
